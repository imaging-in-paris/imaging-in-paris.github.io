  title: "On support localisation, the Fisher metric and optimal sampling in off-the-grid sparse regularisation"
  abstract: "Sparse regularization is a central technique for both machine learning and imaging sciences. Existing performance guarantees assume a separation of the spikes based on an ad-hoc (usually Euclidean) minimum distance condition, which ignore the geometry of the problem. In this talk, we study the BLASSO (i.e. the off-the-grid version of l1 LASSO regularization) and show that the Fisher-Rao distance is the natural way to ensure and quantify support recovery. Under a separation imposed by this distance, I will present results which show that stable recovery of a sparse measure can be achieved when the sampling complexity is (up to log factors) linear with sparsity. On deconvolution problems, which are translation invariant, this generalizes to the multi-dimensional setting existing results of the literature. For more complex translation-varying problems, such as Laplace transform inversion, this gives the first geometry-aware guarantees for sparse recovery. This is joint work with Nicolas Keriven and Gabriel Peyre."

  title: "Deep Unfolding of a Proximal Interior Point Method for Image Restoration"
  abstract: "Variational methods have started to be widely applied to ill-posed inverse problems since they have the ability to embed 
  prior knowledge about the solution. However, the level of performance of these methods significantly depends on a set of parameters, 
  which can be estimated through computationally expensive and time-consuming processes. In contrast, deep learning offers very generic and efficient architectures, at the expense of explainability, since it is often used as a black-box, without any fine control over its output. Deep unfolding provides a convenient approach to combine variational-based and deep learning approaches. Starting from a variational formulation for image restoration, we develop iRestNet, a neural network architecture obtained by unfolding an interior point proximal algorithm. Hard constraints, encoding desirable properties for the restored image, are incorporated into the network thanks to a logarithmic barrier, while the barrier parameter, the stepsize, and the penalization weight are learned by the network. We derive explicit expressions for the gradient of the proximity operator for various choices of constraints, which allows training iRestNet with gradient descent and backpropagation. In addition, we provide theoretical results regarding the stability of the network. Numerical experiments on image deblurring problems show that the proposed approach outperforms both state-of-the-art variational and machine learning methods in terms of image quality.

  title: "Covariant LEAst-square Re-fitting for Image Restoration"
  abstract: "In this talk, a framework to remove parts of the systematic errors affecting popular restoration algorithms is presented, with a special focus on image processing tasks. Generalizing ideas that emerged for l1 regularization, an approach re-fitting the results of standard methods towards the input data is developed. Total variation regularization and non-local means are special cases of interest. Important covariant information that should be preserved by the re-fitting method are identified, and the importance of preserving the Jacobian (w.r.t. the observed signal) of the original estimator is emphasized. Then, a numerical approach is proposed. It has a twicing flavor and allows re-fitting the restored signal by adding back a local affine transformation of the residual term. The benefits of the method are illustrated on numerical simulations for image restoration tasks.

  title: "Image generative modeling for future prediction or inspirational purposes"
  abstract: "Generative models, and in particular adversarial ones, are becoming prevalent in computer vision as they enable enhancing artistic creation, inspire designers, prove usefulness in semi-supervised learning or robotics applications. An important prerequisite towards intelligent behavior is the ability to anticipate future events. Predicting the appearance of future video frames is a proxy task towards pursuing this ability. We will present how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can help, and novel approaches predicting in higher level feature spaces of semantic segmentations. In a second part, we will see how to develop the abilities of GANs to deviate from training examples to generate novel images. Finally, as a limitation of GANs is the production of raw images of low resolution, we present solutions to produce vectorized results."

  title: "Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs"
  abstract: "In the past years, deep learning methods have achieved unprecedented performance on a broad range of problems in various fields from computer vision to speech recognition. So far research has mainly focused on developing deep learning methods for grid-structured data, while many important applications have to deal with graph-structured data. Such geometric data are becoming increasingly important in computer graphics and 3D vision, sensor networks, drug design, biomedicine, recommendation systems, and web applications. The purpose of this talk is to introduce the emerging field of deep learning on graphs, overview existing solutions as well as applications for this class of problems."

  title: "A varifold approach to surface approximation and curvature estimation on point clouds"
  abstract: "We propose a natural framework for the study of surfaces and their different discretizations based on varifolds. Varifolds have been introduced by Almgren to carry out the study of minimal surfaces. Though mainly used in the context of rectifiable sets, they turn out to be well suited to the study of discrete type objects as well. Joint work with Gian Paolo Leonardi (Modena) and Simon Masnou (Lyon)."

  title: "Quadratically regularized optimal transport"
  abstract: "Among regularization techniques for optimal transport, entropic regularization has played a pivotal rule. The main reason may be its computational simplicity: the Sinkhorn-Knopp iteration can be implemented in two- or even one line ad enjoys a linear convergence rate. However, some care is needed to calculate optimizer for small regularization parameters and convergence can be quite slow for badly behaved data. Faster algorithms, e.g. Newton methods, are hard to analyze and tend to be unstable in practice. Moreover, the continuous theory is intricate in this case and takes place in Orlicz-Luxemburg spaces (as we will illustrate in this talk).
After sketching parts of the continuous theory for entropic regularization, we will analyze a different regularizer, namely a simple quadratic penalty. First our focus lies on the continuous case where it is still quite challenging to show existence of suitable solutions for the dual problem. Then we will derive different numerical methods for the discrete problem which include a globally convergent Newton method which converges very fast to high accuracy even for fairly small regularization parameters.
The talk is based on joint work with Christoph Brauer, Christian Clason, Paul Manns, Christian Meyer, and Benedikt Wirth."

  title: "An atomic norm perspective on total variation regularization in image processing"
  abstract: "It is folklore knowledge that the total (gradient) variation regularization tends to promote piecewise constant ``cartoon-like'' images. In this talk I will relate that property to the description of the extreme points of the total variation unit ball. 
These extreme points have been characterized by Ambrosio, Caselles, Masnou and Morel as the indicator functions of ``simple sets''. I will explain how it is possible to describe the solutions of variational problems as a sum of such functions, by using a general representation principle.
This is a joint work with C. Boyer, A. Chambolle, Y. De Castro, F. de Gournay and P. Weiss."

  title: "Blind Ptychography: Theory and Algorithm"
  abstract: "Blind ptychography is a phase retrieval method using multiple coded diffraction patterns from different, overlapping parts of the unknown extended object illuminated with an unknown window function. As such blind ptychography is the inverse problem of simultaneous recovery of the object and the window function given the intensities of  the windowed Fourier transform. 
We derive a general set of conditions under which the object and the window function can be uniquely determined up to a scaling factor and an affine phase factor. We also characterize all the other ambiguities inherent to the raster scan which consists of the shift positions of  the standard windowed Fourier transform and propose an explicit remedy. Finally, we present  a reconstruction algorithm based on the Douglas-Rachford Splitting with initialization informed by the uniqueness theory."
