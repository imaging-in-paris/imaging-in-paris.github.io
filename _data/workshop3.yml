  title: "Predicting aesthetic appreciation of images"
  abstract: "Image aesthetics has become an important criterion for visual content curation on social media sites and media content repositories. Previous
work on aesthetic prediction models in the computer vision community has
focused on aesthetic score prediction or binary image labeling. However,
raw aesthetic annotations are in the form of score histograms and
provide richer and more precise information than binary labels or mean
scores. In this talk I will present recent work at Naver Labs Europe on
the rarely-studied problem of predicting aesthetic score distributions.
The talk will cover the large-scale dataset we collected for this
problem, called AVA, and will describe the novel deep architecture and
training procedure for our score distribution model. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art results on AVA for three tasks: (i) aesthetic quality
classification; (ii) aesthetic score regression; and (iii) aesthetic
score distribution prediction, all while using one model trained only
for the distribution prediction task. I will also discuss our proposed
method for modifying an image such that its predicted aesthetics
changes, and describe how this modification can be used to gain insight
into our model."
