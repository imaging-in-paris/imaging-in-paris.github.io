  title: "Posterior sampling in imaging with learnt priors: from Langevin to diffusion models"
  abstract: "In this talk we explore some recent techniques to perform posterior sampling for ill-posed inverse problems in imaging when the likelihood is known explicitly, and the prior is only known implicitly via a denoising neural network that has been pretrained on a large collection of images. We show how to extend the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) to this particular setting leading to Plug & Play ULA. We explore the convergence properties of PnP-ULA, the crucial role of the stepsize and its relationship with the smoothness of the prior and the likelihood. In order to relax stringent constraints on the stepsize, annealed Langevin algorithms have been proposed, which are tightly related to generative denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM). The image prior that is implicit in these generative models can be adapted to perform posterior sampling, by a clever use of Gaussian approximations, with varying degrees of accuracy, like in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Pseudo-Inverse Guided Diffusion Models (PiGDM). We conclude with an application to blind deblurring, where DPS and PiGDM are used in combination with an Expectation Maximization algorithm to jointly estimate the unknown blur kernel, and sample sharp images from the posterior. <br/>

  title: "An analysis of the noise schedule for score-based generative models."
  abstract: "Score-based generative models (SGMs) aim at estimating a target data distribution by learning score functions using only noise-perturbed samples from the target. Recent literature has focused extensively on assessing the error between the target and estimated distributions, gauging the generative quality through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Wasserstein distances. Under mild assumptions on the data distribution, we establish an upper bound for the KL divergence between the target and the estimated distributions, explicitly depending on any time-dependent noise schedule. Under additional regularity assumptions, taking advantage of favorable underlying contraction mechanisms, we provide a tighter error bound in Wasserstein distance compared to state-of-the-art results. In addition to being tractable, this upper bound jointly incorporates properties of the target distribution and SGM hyperparameters that need to be tuned during training."
