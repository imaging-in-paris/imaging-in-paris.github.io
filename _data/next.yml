  title: "Exoplanet detection by direct imaging: a data-processing method based on
patch covariances"
  abstract: "The search for exoplanets is a very active subject in astronomy. Direct observation of exoplanets requires the combination of a large telescope, an extreme adaptive-optics system, a coronagraph, and dedicated data processing methods. This presentation will discuss the importance of a good statistical model of the data and describe an approach to account for the non-stationary spatial correlations in the background signal. Compared to existing approaches, this model more closely describes the data and thus leads to improved sensitivity, more accurate photometric and astrometric characterizations and more reliable results (in particular, a controlled probability of false alarms). Results obtained with the SPHERE instrument operated by the ESO at the Very Large Telescope in Chile confirm the performance of the method. An extension of the model to microscopy will also be presented.
This is a joint work with Olivier Flasseur (Laboratoire Hubert Curien, CNRS/Univ St Etienne/IOGS), Eric Thiébaut and Maud Langlois (Centre de
Recherche en Astrophysique de Lyon, CNRS/Univ Lyon 1/ENS Lyon)."
