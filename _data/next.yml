  title: "Assessing Portrait Quality in Digital Photography: Methods, Challenges, and Innovations"
  abstract: "This talk focuses on the development of deep learning-based image quality assessment methods tailored for digital portrait photography. Emphasizing the estimation of portrait-specific quality attributes, it addresses the challenges in predicting various global and local aspects such as color balance, detail rendering, and facial features across a variety of scenarios. Additionally, the seminar introduces PIQ23, a comprehensive portrait-specific IQA dataset. This dataset includes images from a wide range of smartphone models, annotated for key quality attributes by expert evaluators. The discussion will highlight the dataset's role in understanding the consistency of quality assessments and the potential of integrating semantic information to improve IQA predictions in portrait photography."

  title: "Inverse Problem Regularization with a Variational Autoencoder Prior"
  abstract: "In this presentation, I will introduce various strategies to use pretrained variational autoencoders (VAE) as a prior model to regularize ill-posed image inverse problems, such as deblurring or super-resolution. VAE can model complex data such as images, by defining a latent variable model paramaterized by a deep neural network. However, it is difficult to use the probabilistic model learned by a VAE as a prior for an inverse problem, because it is defined as an intractable integral. In order to circumvent the intractability of the VAE model, I will first present PnP-HVAE, an iterative optimization algorithm which maximizes a joint posterior distribution on an augmented (image-latent) space. PnP-HVAE is adapted to expressive hierarchical VAE models, and enables us to control the strength of the regularization. Additionally, we draw connection with Plug-and-play methods based on deep image denoisers, and we demonstrate the convergence of our algorithm. Next, I will introduce a strategy to sample from the posterior distribution of a super-resolution problem by using a hierarchical VAE (HVAE) as a prior model. To this end, we propose to train an additional encoder on degraded observation in order to condition the HVAE generative process on the degraded observation. We demonstrate that our approach provides sample quality on par with recent diffusion models while being significantly more computationally efficient."
