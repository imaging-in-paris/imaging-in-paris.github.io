  title: "A variational model for mixed noise removal: analysis, optimisation and structure of solutions"
  abstract: "In several real-word imaging applications such as microscopy, astronomy and medical imaging, a combination of transmission and acquisition faults result in multiple noise statistics in the observed image, such as impulsive/Gaussian or Gaussian/Possion mixtures.  By means of a joint MAP estimation, we derive a statistically consistent variational model where single data fidelities are combined in a handy infimal convoution fashion to model the noise mixture and separated from each other via a Total Variation smoothing. By means of a fine analysis in suitable function spaces, we then study the structure of the solutions of the corresponding variational model and propose a bilevel optimisation strategy for the estimation of the optimal regularisation weights.
This is joint work with C.B. Schönlieb (University of Cambridge, UK), J.C. De Los Reyes (ModeMat, Quito, Ecuador)  and K. Papafitsoros (WIAS Institue, Berlin, Germany)."
