  title: "Understanding and organising the latent space of autoencoders"
  abstract: "Autoencoders are neural networks which project data to and from a lower dimensional latent space, the projection being learned via training on the data. While these networks produce impressive results, there is as yet little understanding of the internal mechanisms which allow autoencoders to produce such results. The work presented here has two goals. First of all, we aim to understand how the autoencoder encodes and decodes simple geometric attributes (size and position) in a very simple setting (images of disks, or simple impulses). Secondly, we present an algorithm whose goal is to organise the latent space of an autoencoder in a manner similar to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), such that each component of the latent space be statistically independent and organised in an decreasing order of importance, with respect to the $\\ell^2$ norm of the reconstruction error. We refer to this autoencoder as a PCA-autoencoder. We discuss an extension of this approach to Generative Adversarial Networks. Finally we show experimental results both in controlled settings with geometrical shapes, as well as on more complex data such as the faces of Celeb-a, where our algorithm is able to discover high-level characteristics such as hair colour, smile etc. without any access to the labels of these characteristics."
