  title: Polarimetric Fourier Phase Retrieval
  abstract: This work introduces polarimetric Fourier phase retrieval (PPR), a physically-inspired model to leverage polarization of light information in Fourier phase retrieval problems. We provide a complete characterization of its uniqueness properties by unraveling equivalencies with two related problems, namely bivariate phase retrieval and a polynomial autocorrelation factorization problem. In particular, we show that the problem admits a unique solution, which can be formulated as a greatest common divisor (GCD) of measurements polynomials. As a result, we propose algebraic solutions for PPR based on approximate GCD computations using the null-space properties Sylvester matrices. Alternatively, existing iterative algorithms for phase retrieval, semidefinite positive relaxation and Wirtinger-Flow, are carefully adapted to solve the PPR problem. Finally, a set of numerical experiments permits a detailed assessment of the numerical behavior and relative performances of each proposed reconstruction strategy. They further demonstrate the fruitful combination of algebraic and iterative approaches towards a scalable, computationally efficient and robust to noise reconstruction strategy for PPR.

  title: Mathematical analysis of Plug and Play methods for inverse problems in imaging
  abstract: Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods constitute a class of iterative algorithms for imaging problems where regularization is performed by a off-the-shelf denoiser. Specifically, given an image dataset, optimizing a function (e.g. a neural network) to remove Gaussian noise is equivalent to approximating the gradient or the proximal operator of the log prior of the training dataset. Therefore, any off-the-shelf denoiser can be used as an implicit prior and inserted into an optimization scheme to restore images. But the resulting PnP scheme may not directly correspond to the minimization of an explicit functional, and its convergence is thus not straightforward. In this talk, we will present several approaches that were proposed to study the convergence of such a PnP algorithm, relying on tools from non-convex optimization and fixed point theory. In particular, we will see that it is possible to learn a denoiser that writes as a gradient-step on an explicit functional, which leads to a PnP algorithm with precise numerical control in addition to state-of-the-art image restoration performance.

  title: Patch and attention for image editing
  abstract: We show through two different examples that patch-based methods remain relevant despite the widespread use of neural networks for many image editing tasks. We first present a patch-based algorithm for single image generation that performs as well as a neural network without requiring a costly training phase. We ensure visual fidelity and diversity of the results by carefully choosing the initialization of the algorithm. In the second part, we show that patch-based algorithms can benefit to modern techniques such as attention mechanisms. The use of attention has helped deep learning introduce long range dependencies but computing the full attention matrix is an expensive step with heavy memory and computational loads. We propose an efficient attention layer based on the stochastic algorithm PatchMatch, which is used for determining approximate nearest neighbors. Our layer has a greatly reduced memory complexity compared to other attention layers, scaling to high resolution images.

  title: Scaling Painting Style Transfer
  abstract: Neural style transfer is a deep learning technique that produces an unprecedentedly rich style transfer from a style image to a content image and is particularly impressive when it comes to transferring style from a painting to an image. It was originally achieved by solving an optimization problem to match the global style statistics of the style image while preserving the local geometric features of the content image. The two main drawbacks of this original approach is that it is computationally expensive and that the resolution of the output images is limited by high GPU memory requirements. Many solutions have been proposed to both accelerate neural style transfer and increase its resolution, but they all compromise the quality of the produced images. Indeed, transferring the style of a painting is a complex task involving features at different scales, from the colour palette and compositional style to the fine brushstrokes and texture of the canvas. This paper provides a solution to solve the original global optimization for ultra-high resolution images, enabling multiscale style transfer at unprecedented image sizes. This is achieved by spatially localizing the computation of each forward and backward passes through the VGG network. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons show that our method produces a style transfer of unmatched quality for such high resolution painting styles.

  title: A sub-Riemannian cortical model with frequency-phase and its application to image processing
  abstract: In this talk, we will see a new geometrical model of the primary visual cortex together with its application to image enhancement and completion. Our departure point is the visual cortex model of the orientation selective cortical neurons, which was presented in [1]. We spatially extend this model to a five dimensional sub-Riemannian geometry and provide a novel geometric framework of the mammalian visual cortex which models orientation-frequency selective, phase shifted cortical cell behavior and the associated neural connectivity. The model extracts orientation, spatial frequency and phase information of the objects in any given two dimensional input image. Such information provides a characterization of the object boundaries and textures in the input image. We provide an image enhancement algorithm based on multi-frequency Laplace-Beltrami flow in the sub-Riemannian framework of the model. This algorithm can be modified so as to be used for image completion as well.

  title: Reproducing sensory induced visual hallucinations via neural fields
  abstract: Understanding the interaction between retinal stimulation and the cortical response in the primary visual cortex (V1 for short) is a significant challenge in improving our insight into human perception and visual organisation. In this talk we will present recent work on the reproduction of various visual illusions via continuous neural field models. In particular, we will present recent results in collaboration with Y. Chitour and C. Tamekue on the modelling via Wilson-Cowan equations of MacKay-type effects (i.e., phantom images induced by geometric patterns), showing that while the classical MacKay effect (Nature, 1957) can be recovered via a linear model, the experiences of Billock and Tsou (PNAS, 2007) are fundamentally due to the presence of a non-linearity

  title: "Measuring uncertainty in human visual segmentation"
  abstract: "Segmenting visual inputs into distinct groups of features and visual objects is central to visual function. Traditional psychophysics uncovered many rules of human perceptual segmentation, and progress in machine learning produced successful algorithms. Yet, the computational logic of human segmentation remains unclear, because we lack well-controlled paradigms to measure perceptual segmentation maps and compare models quantitatively. Here we propose a new, integrated approach: given an image, we measure multiple same--different judgments and perform model--based reconstruction of the underlying segmentation map. The reconstruction is robust to several experimental manipulations and captures the variability of individual participants. We demonstrate the approach on human segmentation of natural images and composite textures, and we show that image uncertainty affects measured human variability as well as how participants weigh different visual features. Because any segmentation algorithm can be plugged in to perform the reconstruction, our paradigm affords quantitative tests of theories of perception as well as new benchmarks for segmentation algorithms."

  title: "Hybrid AI for knowledge representation and model-based medical image understanding - Towards explainability"
  abstract: "This presentation will focus on hybrid AI, as a step towards explainability, more specifically in the domain of spatial reasoning and image understanding. Image understanding benefits from the modeling of knowledge about both the scene observed and the objects it contains as well as their relationships. We show in this context the contribution of hybrid artificial intelligence, combining different types of formalisms and methods, and combining knowledge with data. Knowledge representation may rely on symbolic and qualitative approaches, as well as semi-qualitative ones to account for their imprecision or vagueness. Structural information can be modeled in several formalisms, such as graphs, ontologies, logical knowledge bases, or neural networks, on which reasoning will be based. Image understanding is then expressed as a problem of spatial reasoning. These approaches will be illustrated with examples in medical imaging, illustrating the usefulness of combining several approaches."
