  title: "A few years of non-convex off-the-grid estimation"
  abstract: "In this talk, we focus on non-convex approaches for off-the-grid spike estimation. Centered around the study of basins of attraction of a non-convex functional, we explain how the study of recovery guarantees can be generally linked with the number of available measurements. With a general result on non-convex estimation of low-dimensional models, we show that the size of basins of attraction explicitly increases with respect to the number of measurements, with tight bounds for spikes recovery. These results lead to the conception of a fast algorithm for the recovery of many off-the-grid spikes: over-parametrized projected gradient descent (OP-PGD), showing promising results on realistic datasets. We also are able to give a theoretical partial control of the quality of continuous orthogonal matching pursuit without sliding which is the  initialization procedure of OP-PGD."

  title: "Measuring dissimilarity with diffeomorphism invariance"
  abstract: "Measures of similarity (or dissimilarity) are a key
ingredient to many machine learning algorithms. We introduce DID, a
pairwise dissimilarity measure applicable to a wide range of data
spaces, which leverages the data's internal structure to be invariant to
diffeomorphisms. We prove that DID enjoys properties which make it
relevant for theoretical study and practical use. By representing each
datum as a function, DID is defined as the solution to an optimization
problem in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and can be expressed in
closed-form. In practice, it can be efficiently approximated via Nyström
sampling. Empirical experiments support the merits of DID.
