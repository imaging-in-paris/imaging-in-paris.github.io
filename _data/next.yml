  title: "Successes and pitfalls of bilevel optimization in machine learning"
  abstract: "In this talk, I will introduce bilevel optimization (BO) as a powerful framework to address several machine learning-related problems, including hyperparameter tuning, meta-learning, and data cleaning. Based on this formulation, I will describe some successes of BO, particularly in a strongly convex setting, where strong guarantees can be provided along with efficient stochastic algorithms. I will also discuss the outstanding issues of this framework, presenting geometrical and computational complexity results that show the potential difficulties in going beyond convexity, at least from a theoretical perspective."

  title: "Supervised erased ink detection in damaged palimpsested manuscripts"
  abstract: "Transcribing a historical manuscript is a tedious task, especially in the case of palimpsests, where the sought text was erased and overwritten with another text. Recently, advancements in deep learning text recognition models, especially in multimodal large language models, have raised hopes for future automatization of this process. However, the two issues have prevented this progress so far. First, the absence of sufficient ground-truth data. Historical texts transcription platform Transkribus, estimates that approximately 20-30 pages of transcribed pages are required for training a model, which is already a very difficult task for historians. We assume that was meant for an undamaged manuscript, since remarks are made about enlarging the dataset in case of more variations. Second is the extreme damage to the text, which pushes us to image text in more complex modalities than a simple image scan. Thus, instead of capturing the text image, the push was made to capture the chemical composition of materials. One of the most popular systems for this became multispectral imaging systems. While it will not capture the chemical composition, it reveals the difference in the spectrum of materials.  However, until recently, msi palimpsest imaging systems lacked the data standardization procedures that created perturbation unrelated to the data composition, enabling the usage of the text transcription model on raw data. However, more and more attempts are being made to apply the standardization of multispectral imaging. This will allow us not only to create substantial data collection but also to unleash the potential presented by multispectral imaging. Our goal in this work is to test the capacity of neural network to detect the traces of undertext."
