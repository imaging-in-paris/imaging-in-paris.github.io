  title: "Measuring dissimilarity with diffeomorphism invariance"
  abstract: "Measures of similarity (or dissimilarity) are a key
ingredient to many machine learning algorithms. We introduce DID, a
pairwise dissimilarity measure applicable to a wide range of data
spaces, which leverages the data's internal structure to be invariant to
diffeomorphisms. We prove that DID enjoys properties which make it
relevant for theoretical study and practical use. By representing each
datum as a function, DID is defined as the solution to an optimization
problem in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and can be expressed in
closed-form. In practice, it can be efficiently approximated via Nyström
sampling. Empirical experiments support the merits of DID.
