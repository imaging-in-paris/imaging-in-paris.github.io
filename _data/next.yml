  title: "Fighting misinformation in satellite imagery"
  abstract: "Satellite imagery is quickly gaining in importance; it is a critical component in many areas, among which external security. It is thus necessary to question the reliability of such data. Is it possible to guarantee that a satellite image is authentic? How can one be protected against an organization which would try to hide illegal military gear, or reversely try to push others into action by falsely pretending that it possesses such equipments? Although forensic analysis has received a lot of academic attention these past few years, it is mostly limited to photographies; there is little research done on satellite image forensics. We propose to explore how an attacker might create satellite image forgeries, and most importantly how to defend oneself against such content. Unsupervised or self-supervised methods will be developed to analyse traces left by the processing pipeline of satellite images, so as to authentify images and detect forged ones."

  title: "Towards explainable image forensics with resampling trace analysis in the Fourier domain"
  abstract: "Synthetic image generation methods have recently revolutionized the way in which visual content is created. However, these methods leave traces in the Fourier spectrum, which are invisible to humans but can be effectively detected by specialized tools. More specifically, some of the spectral artifacts are related to the upsampling operations employed in generative models. In this talk, I will first present a semi-white-box method dedicated to detecting synthetic images by revealing the artifacts in the Fourier domain. Then I will present a theoretical study on the artifacts left by general resampling operations, and introduce an unsupervised method that detects the traces of resampling operations in the large sense using an a contrario framework for false alarm control."

  title: "Contrastive Learning in Computer Vision and Medical Imaging - A metric learning approach"
  abstract: "Contrastive Learning (CL) is a paradigm designed for self-supervised representation learning which has been applied to unsupervised, weakly supervised and supervised problems. The objective in CL is to estimate a parametric mapping function that maps positive samples (semantically similar) close together in the representation space and negative samples (semantically dissimilar) far away from each other. In general, positive samples can be defined in different ways depending on the problem: transformations (i.e., augmentations) of the same image (unsupervised setting), samples belonging to the same class (supervised) or with similar image attributes (weakly-supervised). The definition of negative samples varies accordingly. In this talk, we will show how a metric learning approach for CL allows us to: 1- better formalize recent contrastive losses, such as InfoNCE and SupCon, 2- derive new losses for unsupervised, supervised, and weakly supervised problems, and 3- propose new regularization terms for debiasing. Furthermore, leveraging the proposed metric learning approach and kernel theory, we will describe a novel loss, called decoupled uniformity, that allows the integration of prior knowledge, given either by generative models or weak attributes, and removes the positive-negative coupling problem, as in the InfoNCE loss. We validate the usefulness of the proposed losses on standard vision datasets and medical imaging data."
