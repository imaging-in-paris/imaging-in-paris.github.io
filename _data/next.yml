  title: "Approximation with sparsely connected deep networks"
  abstract: "Many of the data analysis and processing pipelines that have been carefully engineered by generations of mathematicians and practitioners can in fact be implemented as deep networks. Allowing the parameters of these networks to be automatically trained (or even randomized) allows to revisit certain classical constructions.

The talk first describes an empirical approach to approximate a given matrix by a fast linear transform through numerical optimization. The main idea is to write fast linear transforms as products of few sparse factors, and to iteratively optimize over the factors. This corresponds to training a sparsely connected, linear, deep neural network. Learning algorithms exploiting iterative hard-threshol

  title: "Fast piecewise-affine motion estimation without segmentation"
  abstract: "In this talk, we will review existing strategies for regularizing motion fields, and present a new method dedicated to piecewise affine models. Current algorithmic approaches for piecewise affine motion estimation are based on alternating motion segmentation and estimation. In contrast, our method estimates piecewise affine motion directly without intermediate segmentation. To this end, we reformulate the problem by imposing piecewise constancy of the parameter field, and derive a specific proximal splitting optimization scheme. A key component of our framework is an efficient 1D piecewise-affine estimator for vector-valued signals. The first advantage of our approach over segmentation-based methods is its absence of initialization. The second advantage is its lower computational cost, which is independent of the complexity of the motion field. In addition to these features, we demonstrate competitive accuracy with other piecewise-parametric methods on standard evaluation benchmarks. Our new regularization scheme also outperforms the more standard use of total variation and total generalized variation."
