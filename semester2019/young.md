We would like to offer the opportunity to PhD students and Post Docs working on topics related to the thematic program to present their work.

Starting from Wednesday 20 February, we will organise every Wednesday (except for Wednesday March 13) a two-hour session from 14:00 to 16:00 dedicated to young researchers in order give them a chance to stimulate the scientific discussion.

Priority will be given to young researchers attending the program, but all contributions are encouraged.

If you are interested to present your work, send us an e-mail with your date preference, a brief description of your research topics and a tentative title of your talk.
For the first session (Wednesday 20th February) we ask interested speakers to contact us by *Wednesday February 13*.



The organisers,
